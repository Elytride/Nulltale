# AlterEcho

> **Gemini 3.0 Hackathon 2026 Submission**

**AlterEcho** is a digital persona system that allows you to "resurrect" or clone digital personalities from chat history and voice samples. By analyzing linguistic patterns from Instagram/Discord logs and cloning voice profiles using WaveSpeed, AlterEcho creates a hyper-realistic AI companion that speaks and texts exactly like the original person.

## Features

-   **Linguistic Style Analysis**: Mathematically deconstructs chat logs to replicate vocabulary, sarcasm patterns, and emotional tone.
-   **Voice Cloning**: Integrates WaveSpeed MiniMax 2.6 Turbo for high-fidelity voice synthesis.
-   **Multi-Source Import**: Supports Instagram (`.json`) and Discord (`.zip`) chat exports.
-   **Hybrid Memory**: Combines static style guides with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for accurate long-term memory.
-   **Local-First**: Data stays on your machine (`backend/data/`).

## Local Setup Guide

Follow these steps to run AlterEcho locally.

### Prerequisites
-   **Python 3.10+**
-   **Node.js 18+** (for the frontend)
-   **Gemini API Key** (from Google AI Studio)
-   **WaveSpeed API Key** (for voice features)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Elytride/AlterEcho.git
cd AlterEcho
```

### 2. Backend Setup
The backend runs on Flask and handles all AI processing.

1.  Navigate to the backend folder:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the server:
    ```bash
    python api.py
    ```
    *The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.*

### 3. Frontend Setup
The frontend is a modern React application built with Vite.

1.  Open a new terminal and navigate to the root folder:
    ```bash
    cd AlterEcho
    ```
2.  Install Node dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Powered by Gemini

AlterEcho relies heavily on the **Gemini Ecosystem** to power every aspect of the pipeline. It uses advanced features to create a truly lifelike persona:

### 1. Style Hyper-Profiling (Long Context)
We leverage Gemini's massive context window to feed *thousands* of chat messages into a single prompt.
*   **The Task**: Sort, organize, and analyze raw unstructured chat formats (Instagram/Discord).
*   **The Output**: A rigorous "Linguistic Style Guide" that deconstructs the user's vocabulary, sarcasm patterns, emoji usage, and emotional baselines.
*   *Why Gemini?*: Its ability to hold the entire history in context allows it to find subtle patterns that RAG chunks would miss.

### 2. Native Function Calling
The chatbot isn't just text. It uses **Gemini Function Calling** to autonomously interact with the world.
*   **Tools**: We define tools like `generate_or_edit_image`.
*   **Autonomy**: Users don't need to type special commands. If you say *"Send me a selfie"* or *"Make that picture darker"*, Gemini understands the intent ("Is this a tool call?") and executes the function naturally.

### 3. Multimodal Vision
AlterEcho can **see**.
*   **Visual Understanding**: You can upload images to the chat, and Gemini will analyze them and react in character (e.g., *"Omg that cat is so cute!!"* or *"Where did you buy those shoes??"*).
*   **Image Editing**: It maintains an "Image History", allowing it to reference, understand, and even *edit* previous images in the conversation multimodally.

### 4. Low-Latency Streaming
For the voice feature (`StreamChat`), speed is critical.
*   **Architecture**: We use `generate_content_stream` to get token-by-token output.
*   **Pipeline**: As soon as Gemini generates the first few words, they are cleaned and piped directly into the WaveSpeed TTS engine. This results in a near-instant conversational flow that feels like a real phone call.
