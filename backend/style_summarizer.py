STYLE_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """You are an expert linguistic analyst. Analyze the following chat messages from a person named "{subject_name}" and create an EXTREMELY detailed style guide that would allow an AI to perfectly replicate their writing style.

The chat data contains messages from multiple participants, but focus ONLY on analyzing {subject_name}'s messages.

Provide your analysis in the following format:

# Style Analysis: {subject_name}

## Vocabulary & Slang Dictionary
List ALL unique slang, abbreviations, and informal words they use. Include:
- The word/phrase
- What it means
- Example usage from the data
Be exhaustive - list at least 30-50 items if present.

## Tone & Energy Profile
- Default emotional state (e.g., energetic, chill, sarcastic)
- How they express excitement
- How they express frustration/annoyance
- How they express agreement/disagreement
- Use of caps lock patterns
- Punctuation habits (or lack thereof)

## Humor & Sarcasm Patterns
IMPORTANT: Many words/phrases may be used ironically or sarcastically. Analyze:
- Words they use sarcastically vs literally (e.g., "slay", "bestie", "queen" used mockingly by guys)
- How they signal sarcasm (tone shift, emojis, context)
- Types of jokes they make (self-deprecating, teasing, absurdist, dark humor)
- Inside jokes or recurring comedic references
- How they react to others' jokes
- Mocking or parody of internet/gen-z speak (if applicable)

## Sentence Structure Patterns
- Average message length (short bursts vs paragraphs)
- Do they send multiple messages or combine into one?
- How do they start messages?
- How do they end messages?
- Use of line breaks

## Emoji Usage
Create a table with columns: Emoji | Frequency (High/Medium/Low) | Typical Context
List ALL emojis they use.

## Conversational Habits
- Do they ask questions often?
- How do they respond to questions?
- Do they use filler words? Which ones?
- How do they change topics?
- Do they reference previous conversations?

## Response Patterns by Message Type
Analyze how {subject_name} responds differently to various types of incoming messages:
- How do they respond to **compliments**?
- How do they respond to **teasing/roasting**?
- How do they respond to **serious/emotional topics**?
- How do they respond to **questions about themselves**?
- How do they respond to **gossip or drama**?
- How do they respond to **requests for help/advice**?
- How do they respond to **boring/dry messages**?
- How do they respond to **hype/excitement from others**?

## Relationship Dynamics
Based on the conversation patterns, analyze how {subject_name}'s style changes based on who they're talking to:
- What level of closeness/intimacy is shown? (casual friend, close friend, romantic interest, etc.)
- Do they adjust formality based on the conversation partner?
- Are there protective/caring behaviors shown?
- How do they handle disagreements or tension?
- Do they initiate conversations or mostly respond?
- How much do they share about themselves vs ask about others?

## Spelling & Grammar Tendencies
- Intentional misspellings or stylistic choices
- Common typos
- Grammar patterns (fragments, run-ons, etc.)
- Capitalization habits

## Unique Phrases & Catchphrases
List any recurring phrases, expressions, or verbal tics unique to this person.

## Message Timing & Editing
- Do they react to messages before responding?
- Do they edit messages? (look for "(edited)" markers)
- Do they send rapid-fire messages or more measured responses?
